        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Exciting news! We've embarked on a thrilling journey to establish our online presence, bringing the heart-pounding excitement of white-water rafting straight to your fingertips. Our decision to dive into the digital realm is fueled by a commitment to providing an immersive and seamless experience for both seasoned adventurers and those taking their first plunge into the world of rafting.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Our target customers are individuals aged 25-40 who are passionate about sustainable living, eco-friendly products, and a healthy lifestyle. They are environmentally conscious and seek ways to make a positive impact on the planet through their choices. Many of them are well-educated professionals with a moderate to high financial capacity to invest in sustainable practices.<br>
            
        They want access to a platform that curates information, products, and tips for sustainable living. Our customers are interested in discovering eco-friendly alternatives for everyday products, staying informed about environmental issues, and adopting practices that align with their values. They seek a sense of community and shared values with others who are committed to making environmentally conscious choices. <br>

        When accessing our website, they expect to find a well-organized hub of information on sustainable living. This includes guides on reducing carbon footprint, product reviews for eco-friendly alternatives, and articles on the latest advancements in green technology. They anticipate a user-friendly interface that encourages exploration and discovery, fostering a sense of community engagement. <br>
            
        While there are sources providing information on sustainability, our target customers often find it challenging to navigate through the vast amount of available content. They desire a platform that not only educates but also simplifies the process of adopting sustainable practices in their daily lives. A lack of curated, trustworthy recommendations for eco-friendly products and a sense of community is a gap we aim to fill. Our customers need a reliable source that understands their values and provides actionable steps towards a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
